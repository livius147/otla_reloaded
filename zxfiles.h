ID : 11 - Turbo Loading Data Block
This block is very similar to the normal TAP block but with some additional info on the timings and other important differences. The same tape encoding is used as for the standard speed data block.

ID : 15  -  Direct recording
-------
        This block is used for tapes  which have some  parts in  a format  such
        that the  turbo loader  block cannot  be used. This is *not* like a VOC
        file, since the information is much more compact.  Each sample value is
        represented  by one  bit only  (0 for low, 1 for high) which means that
        the block will be at most 1/8 the size of the equivalent VOC.

        *Please* use this  block  *only*  if  you cannot  use the turbo loading
        block.  The preffered sampling frequencies are  22050 (158 T states) or
        44100  Hz  (79 T states/sample).  Please, if  you can, don't  use other
        sampling frequencies.

00 2  Number of T states per sample (bit of data)
02 2  Pause after this block in milliseconds (ms)
04 1  Used bits (samples) in last byte of data (1-8)
      i.e. If this is 2 only first two samples of the last byte will be played
05 3  Data length
08 x  Data. Each bit represents a state on the EAR port (i.e. one sample);
      MSb is played first.
